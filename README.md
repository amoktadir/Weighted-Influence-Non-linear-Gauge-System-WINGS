A Python implementation of the WINGS for multi-criteria decision-making, based on the research paper by Jerzy Michnik (2013). This interactive web application provides an intuitive interface for implementing wings with real-time analysis.

## Overview-WINGS
The WINGS (Weighted Influence Non-linear Gauge System) method is a decision-making tool that helps analyze complex systems with interrelated components. This platform allows you to perform WINGS analysis using either linguistic terms or direct numerical values.

## Step-by-Step Guide
## Configuration (Sidebar)
-Select your input model: Linguistic Terms or Real Data
-Specify the number of components in your system
-For linguistic models, specify the number of experts
-Name each component for easy reference
-Input Data

## Component Strengths: For each component, specify its internal strength/importance
-Influence Matrix: Define how each component influences others
-Use the expandable Linguistic Terms Mapping reference if needed
-Run Analysis

## Click the "Run WINGS Analysis" button to process your inputs
-The system will calculate prominence and relation values
-Interpret Results

-Flowchart: Visual representation of components and their interactions
-Matrices: View the various calculated matrices
-Results: See prominence and relation values for each component
-Classification: Components are classified as Causes or Effects
-Visualization: Graphical representations of the analysis

## Input Models
## Linguistic Terms Model
-Use predefined linguistic terms (e.g., AS, ExS, VSS for strength)
-Multiple experts can provide assessments
-Expert weights can be assigned for weighted averages
-Terms are converted to numerical values for calculation
## Real Data Model
-Input numerical values directly
-Suitable when precise measurements are available
-Single "expert" input mode

## Understanding the Results
-Prominence (r+c): Indicates the overall importance of a component in the system
-Relation (r-c):
-Positive values indicate a component is a Cause (influences others more than it's influenced)
-Negative values indicate a component is an Effect (is influenced more than it influences others)

## Tips for Effective Use
-Start with a small number of components to understand the method
-Use descriptive names for components to make interpretation easier
-For linguistic models, ensure all experts understand the term definitions
-Review the flowchart to verify your inputs match your mental model of the system
